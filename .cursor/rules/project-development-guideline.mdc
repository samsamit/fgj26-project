# Project Development Guidelines

## Language

All scripts must be written in **C#** (not GDScript).

## Architecture: Composition Over Inheritance

Follow composed/component-based architecture:

### Principles

- **Small, focused components**: Each node/script handles one responsibility
- **Composition over inheritance**: Build complex behaviors by combining simple components
- **Signals for communication**: Decouple components using Godot signals
- **Resources for shared data**: Use `.tres` resources for data that multiple nodes need

### Example Structure

```csharp
// ❌ BAD - Monolithic class with multiple responsibilities
public partial class Player : CharacterBody3D
{
    // Health, movement, inventory, combat all in one class
}

// ✅ GOOD - Composed from focused components
public partial class Player : CharacterBody3D
{
    // Player just coordinates child components
}

// Separate component nodes:
// - HealthComponent.cs
// - MovementComponent.cs
// - InventoryComponent.cs
// - CombatComponent.cs
```

### Component Communication

```csharp
// ✅ Use signals for loose coupling
[Signal]
public delegate void HealthChangedEventHandler(int newHealth);

// Emit when state changes
EmitSignal(SignalName.HealthChanged, currentHealth);
```
