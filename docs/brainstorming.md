Ideointi:

- splitscreen co-op
  - different lanes but other player reveals the other players map
- amongus with masks
- mask as in image masking
- majoras mask -> different mask gives different functionality
- city scape -> different mask causes different interactions with game
- psycoligical masking
- social masking
  - timelimit for normal mode
  - after limit problems
- what would the hook be?
- world with interactions and dialogues
- hyperfixations on player
  - These helps mask regeneration
- masks gives superpowers

Themes:

- splitsscreen
- co-op with map masking
- mask power storyline
- amongus with masks

- Splitscreen game
  - Other player controls the player
  - Other player constrols the "mask"

Final suggestions:

- AI discussion game (multiplayer?)

  - AI personality detection
  - Different characters for AI npcs
  - city with npcs with different personalities

- platformer/topdown co-op

  - world generation? procedural?
  - puzzles?

- Map could be same -> without generation
- Mask could be the center of the game
- Other controls the mask other the player
- Both need to have something to do all the time
