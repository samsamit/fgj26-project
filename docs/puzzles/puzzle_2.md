# strength

- strength mask

# logic

- Push movable boxes onto pressure plates to open a gate
- Player 2 must position the strength mask on Player 1 to enable pushing
- Without the mask active on the player, boxes are too heavy to move
- Coordinate mask positioning while Player 1 pushes boxes into place

# completion

- All pressure plates have boxes on them, gate opens
- Walk through the opened gate to reach the goal

# next steps

- Find a xray mask
