# gauntlet

- time mask
- strength mask
- flashlight mask

# logic

- A long corridor with fast-moving projectile launchers
- Time mask slows projectiles enough for Player 1 to pass through safely
- The corridor is divided into sections with different challenges:
  - Section 1: Projectiles in darkness - need flashlight mask to see them, then switch to time mask to slow them (memorize positions)
  - Section 2: Projectiles blocked by movable boxes - need strength mask to push boxes into position as barriers, then time mask to pass remaining projectiles
  - Section 3: Both dark AND has projectiles - requires quick mask switching between flashlight (to spot) and time (to slow)
- Player 2 must rapidly switch between masks based on what Player 1 needs
- Getting hit by a projectile resets Player 1 to the start of the current section
