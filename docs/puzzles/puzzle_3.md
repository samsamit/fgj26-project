# minefield

- xray mask

# logic

- Floor is filled with mines, each shown only as a small red light
- When Player 2 hovers the xray mask over a mine, it reveals the full mine and a cord leading to a button
- Buttons toggle (activate/deactivate) connected mines - one button may control multiple mines
- Player 2 must scan the minefield to map out which buttons control which mines
- Player 2 guides Player 1 to press the correct buttons to deactivate mines and create a safe path
- Stepping on an active mine resets the puzzle

# completion

- Navigate through the minefield to reach the goal without triggering any active mines

# next steps
